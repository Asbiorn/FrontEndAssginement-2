# FrontEndAssginement-2
Did not manage to solve the assignment.
I tried to follow dewalds examples to get to a working reference ("ExampleProject"), then copy the project and modify it into the translator app("lost-translation").

I guess a better strategy would be to just use inspiration from the examples for what ever needed functionality. 

# Installation
I probably did it wrong but here is how i did: 

There are some dependencies that will need to be installed in the project, since i read online that best practice is it gitignore the node_modules folder,
they are react-router-dom, navbar, react-hook-form.
